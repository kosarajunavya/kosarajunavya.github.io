      Help them to describe their pain symptoms, including how the pain feels
      and where on their body they experience it. Encourage them to explain
      their pain symptoms and severity to their doctor and to join patient
      support groups. Learn about their pain management plan and help ensure
      that they stick to medication schedules and dosages. Talk to them about
      what their physical, emotional and social needs or limitations are, and
      find out how you can help to improve those areas, so they can maintain a
      good quality of life. Provide assistance if they need to use walking aids
      or splints, and arrange to make their living or working environment both
      safer and more comfortable.
