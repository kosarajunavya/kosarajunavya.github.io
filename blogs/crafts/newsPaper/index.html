      <h2>Steps to design a photo frame</h2>
      <h3>Step1 :</h3>
      <p>
        Take a bunch of old newspapers or any other papers from your old
        notebooks and cut them into small pieces.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/1.jpg" alt="old Newspaper image" />
      <h3>Step2 :</h3>
      <p>Try to roll the paper like this,</p>

      <h3>Step3 :</h3>
      <p>At the end apply some fevicol, and stick it.</p>

      <h3>Step4 :</h3>
      <p>Then do the same and prepare a bunch of newspaper sticks</p>

      <h3>Step5 :</h3>
      <p>Color the sticks with your favorite color</p>
      <h3>Step6 :</h3>
      <p>
        Stick them in different shapes and give some gap on top of the photo
        frame to fix your photo.
