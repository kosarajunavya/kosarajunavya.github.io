          >
          is one of the most important basic skill that every developer should
          learn. So here are few simple methods to find bugs without much time
          consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          GO to <a href="#" target="_blank">My code.blog</a> for to get lot of
          blogs on technologies
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly we have to be aware of what type of debugging methods and
          tools that are available for all of us.
        </p>
        <h2>Pre-requisites:</h2>
        <h3>Tools:</h3>
        <p>
          Most of the developers can use different browsers to connect with the
          world. The major tools are listed here, and now we are going to look
          at how to handle debugging with one of these tools.
        </p>
        <ul class="tools">

          Basically we have 3 methods of debugging our code, before going to
          these methods you should follow these steps to save your time with the
          dealing of bugs.
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Firstly analyse the entire code that you have written</li>
          <li>Then try to split your major issues into small sections</li>
          <li>
            Again read your code step by step and try to find the scope of bug
          </li>
          <li>Then follow the debugging methods to find your bug and fix it</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Method 1: Using console.log()</h2>
        <p>
          Debugging is a process of finding bugs and fixing them. The initial
          method of finding bugs and to understand the reason for an issue and
          fix it is using the console.log method. This method is simple for less
          lines of code, but when it comes to bigger applications it become's a
          head banger for the developper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us see a simple calculator application and analyse the debugging
          process in every method.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./img/bugFound.png"
          alt="screenshot of bug in an example code"
        />
        <p>
          In the above results we got 1+2 = 12, instead of 3. So here is the
          bug, that we are not getting the required outcome. Let us go to our
          code and read the entire code again and write console.log on few
          places to know the scope of a bug.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is my source code for calculator application
          <a
            href="https://kosarajunavya.github.io/Jstasks/task1/index.html"
            target="_blank"
            >https://kosarajunavya.github.io/Jstasks/task1/index.html</a
          >
        </p>
        <img src="./img/console.png" alt="code" />
        <p>See the results in console</p>
        <img src="./img/consoleb.png" alt="browser console image" />
        <p>
          Try to find out the bug here, and the problem is, in javascript if you
          want to add numericals then you have to parse them otherwise the js
          considers the numbers as strings. So the operator that we have used
          here is +. This operator adds the numericals and concatenates the
          string. So, to perform addition operation we have to parse them or use
          the number function to compute the actual numericals.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/consolem.png" alt="code modifications image" />
        <p>Now verify the results in your application</p>
        <img src="./img/result.png" alt="final result screenshot" />
        <p>
          And the bug is fixed and we got expected results. The disadvantage of
          this method is that we have to read each and every line of the code
          and have to include a huge number of console.log(), to find the value
          and to analyse the scope of the bug. This could definitely beat the
          clock. Here is a solution for this, look down for next interesting
          method
        </p>
        <h2>Method 2: Using Breakpoints</h2>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            One of the effective and comfortable ways of debugging is using the
            breakpoints in the respective browser. Here are the steps to handle
            with the breakpoints in Chrome.
          </li>
          <li>
            Firstly analyse the scope of the bug, In this case the bug that we
            found is, in our calculator application instead of summing the
            numericals they are getting concatenated.
          </li>
          <li>
            So the issue raised on the computation part of the code so set a
            breakpoint near the function and run your code there you find the
            bug that you missed to parse the numericals.
          </li>
          <li>So go to your code and update that part</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 1:</h3>
        <p>
          Go to your browser and open your console by hitting f12 in
          windows/linux, cmd J in mac.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/browser.png" alt="console screenshot image" />
        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <p>Go to sources</p>
        <img src="./img/source.png" alt="selecting source screenshot" />
        <h3>Step 3:</h3>
        <p>Select script file</p>
        <img src="./img/script.png" alt="selecting script file screenshot" />
        <h3>Step 4:</h3>
        <p>
          Firstly know your breakpoint for the respective source code that you
          want to debug, in this source code we have an issue on computaion
          part. So enable a breakpoint where actually the computaion part is
          happening. As per the requirement you can give as many as breakpoints
          to understand the flow of our source code.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/breakpoint.png" alt="enabling breakpoint screenshot" />
        <h3>Step 5:</h3>
        <p>
          Now this breakpoint is gonna hit when the calculate button is fireoff,
          so give the two inputs and click the calculate button. Now see what
          happens.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/run.png" alt="debugger paused screenshot" />
        <h3>Step 6:</h3>
        <p>
          Now the debugger pause the code at a given breakpoint now observe the
          flow of code by hitting f10(which helps us to goto next line of the
          code).
        </p>
        <img src="./img/res.png" alt="debugging results" />
        <h3>Step 7:</h3>
        <p>
          Now observe the results, here we can see the results clearly where the
          functionality is going wrong in the scope section, like the results of
          the variables.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 8:</h3>
        <p>Now goto your code and and correct the bug.</p>
        <img src="./img/updatec.png" alt="updated code screenshot" />
        <p>
          Finally go to your console again and enable the breakpoint of your
          modified code, then again give the inputs and check the results.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/resf.png" alt="final result screenshot" />
        <p>
          Perfect! you got the expected results. So, with flexible steps we can
          resolve our issues with the help of breakpoints.
        </p>
        <h2>Method 3: Using Debugger keyword</h2>
        <small>Great! you came till here, Good to see you.</small>
        <p>
          Here is another cool method of debugging. So in this method you need
          to do only one step. Just write the debugger key word in your source
          code, that's all! very simple right.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./img/keyword.png"
          alt="using debugger keyword in code screenshot"
        />
        <p>
          Now go to browser, open console, give the inputs, hit the calculate
          button. Now you can see the debugger is enabled and paused the code
          along with results.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/keywordc.png" alt="results screenshot" />
        <p>
          So you will get the scope of bug the go to your code editor, fix the
          bug. Again cross check your results.

      <p>
        Thats all guys! With this info, you're good to go. Go on and start
        experimenting all your code 😄 with debugger in different areas to get
        to know of your code functionality.
