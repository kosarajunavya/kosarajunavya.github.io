      <h2>Pre-requisites:</h2>

        simple solutions for major problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a solution for one of the headbanging questions for UI
        developers, that is where to use flex-box and grid columns in style
        sheets while designing a website. So, letâ€™s get started with flex-box.
      </p>
      <h2>CSS Flex-box:</h2>
      <p>
        Flex-box is a one-dimensional layout method thatâ€™s gonna deal with
        either rows or columns but not both at a time. The Flex-box module
        follows the hierarchy of parent and child elements. The main container
        acts as a parent and the elements that are present in that parent
        container gonna take the childâ€™s position.
      </p>
      <p>
        The parent container takes the flex as a display method and all the
        child elements are gonna render the properties of flex. You can refer to
        complete the style guide for CSS Flex-box here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Styling websites is one of the major key roles for front-end developers.
        The effective way of creating a responsive design is using flex-box why
        because the properties of flex-box are compatible with all screens-size.
      </p>
      <h3>Areas of application:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For small-scale responsive designs with minimum media queries.</li>
        <li>
          Flexibility in dimension control and spacing between the flex-items.
        </li>
        <li>Re-ordering the flex items is simple.</li>
        <li>
          Organizing all types of responsive navigation with flex properties.
        </li>
        <li>Workable form controls.</li>
        <li>Adjustable media-objects</li>
        <li>Flex has effective results in card layout structuring.</li>
        <li>Supports in all browsers</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Drabacks:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The only drawback in the flex-box module is a few performance issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not a good decision for considering flex for layouts as it is good for
          alignment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>A small demo that shows how the flex-box works:</h3>
      <video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
        <source src="./video/flex.webm" type="video/webm" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
      <h2>CSS grid:</h2>
      <p>
        CSS grid is a two-dimensional layout method thatâ€™s gonna handle both
        rows and columns. The hierarchy is as same as flex-container. You can
        refer complete CSS guid for CSS grid.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of we need to do is applying display:grid property to the block
        elements and defining number of rows and columns by using
        grid-template-coloumn/row properties.The main motive of introducing grid
        module is to design a complex layouts that may not be possible with
        flex-box.
      </p>
      <h3>Areas of application:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you have a complex designs and maintainable websites grid layout
          is prefered over flex.
        </li>
        <li>
          When your layout consists of gap between two block elements, take grid
          concept.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you need to overlap elements grid has an excellent feature with
          grid coloum and row property.
        </li>
        <li>
          When your website design should be planned for layout-first method,
          then grid is the better option.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Drabacks:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Not supported in every browser.</li>
        <li>Choosing grid is a bit difficult for resposive designs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>A small demo that shows how the flex-box works:</h3>
      <video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
        <source src="./video/grid.webm" type="video/webm" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
      <p>
        Finally I just want to conclude that Grid is for layout and flex is for
        alignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thatâ€™s all guys! With this info, you're good to go. Go on and start
        experimenting with all layout and alignment designs with a flex and grid
        module properties.
