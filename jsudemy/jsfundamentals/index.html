    <h2>assignments for values and variables</h2>
    <p>
    1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
    assign their values according to your own country (population in millions) 
    </p>
    <p>2. Log their values to the console</p>


    <!-- <div>
        <p onclick="changeText(this)">click me to get country population</p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <p onclick="changeText(this)">click me to get continent population</p>
    </div> -->

    <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        <button id="myBtn1">click me to get country population</button>
    </div>
    <div>
        <button id="myBtn2">click me to get continent population</button>
    </div>
    <p id="resultCountry"></p>
    <p id="resultContinent"></p>

    <h2>Assignment in Data Types</h2>
    <p>
        1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
        country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
        'language', but don't assign it any value yet
        
    </p>
    <p>2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'to the console</p>
 
    <p class="type">hey click me to the type of data is assigned to me</p>
    <p class="res"></p>

    <p class="type1">hey click me to get the bug in javascript</p>
    <p class="res1"></p>

<hr>
    <h2>Assignment in let, const and var</h2>
    <p>
        1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
        countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)        
    </p>
    <p>2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
        change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
    </p>
    <p>3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens</p>

    <a class="a" href="#">click me to get whether you can change my value or not</a>
    <p class="constResult"></p>
    <p class="reason"></p>

    <h2>Assignment in Basic Operators</h2>
    <p>
        1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
            then how many people would live in each half?    </p>
    <p>2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console</p>
    <p>3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than Finland?</p>
    <p>4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country have less people than the average country?</p>
    <p>5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
        which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
        people speak portuguese'</p>
    
    <h3>Please go to the console to check the result of this assignment</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Assignment in Strings and Template Literals</h2>
    <p>
        1. Recreate the 'description' variable from the last assignment, this time
        using the template literal syntax
    </p>
    <h3>Please go to the console to check the result of this assignment</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Assignment in if / else Statements</h2>
    <p>
        1. If your country's population is greater that 33 million, log a string like this to the
        console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. Otherwise, log a string like
        'Portugal's population is 22 million below average' (the 22 is the average of 33
        minus the country's population)
   </p>
    <p>2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to
        130. See the different results, and set the population back to original
    </p>

<h2>Assignment in Type Conversion and Coercion</h2>
    <p>
        1. Predict the result of these 5 operations without executing them:
        '9' - '5';
        '19' - '13' + '17';
        '19' - '13' + 17;
        '123' < 57;
        5 + 6 + '4' + 9 - 4 - 2;
   </p>
    <p>2. Execute the operations to check if you were right</p>

<h2>Assignment in Equality Operators: == vs. ===</h2>
<p>
    1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this:
        prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country
        have?');
   </p>
<p>2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality
    == for now)
</p>
<p>3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
    is greater than 1
</p>
<p>4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when
    'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)
</p>
<p>5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.</p>
<p>6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of
    'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why
    is this happening?
</p>
<p>7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now
    when you input 1
</p>
<p>8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this
    situation
</p>

<h2>Assignment in Equality Operators: == vs. ===</h2>
<p>
    1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way
   </p>
<p>2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a
    country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an
    island.
</p>
<p>3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her.
    You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take
    your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
</p>
<p>4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If
    not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('
</p>
<p>5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily
    change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in
    Canada :D)</p>
