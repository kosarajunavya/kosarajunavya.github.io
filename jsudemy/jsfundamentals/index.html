    <h2>assignments for values and variables</h2>
    <p>
    1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
    assign their values according to your own country (population in millions) 
    </p>
    <p>2. Log their values to the console</p>


    <!-- <div>
        <p onclick="changeText(this)">click me to get country population</p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <p onclick="changeText(this)">click me to get continent population</p>
    </div> -->

    <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        <button id="myBtn1">click me to get country population</button>
    </div>
    <div>
        <button id="myBtn2">click me to get continent population</button>
    </div>
    <p id="resultCountry"></p>
    <p id="resultContinent"></p>

    <h2>Assignment in Data Types</h2>
    <p>
        1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
        country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
        'language', but don't assign it any value yet
        
    </p>
    <p>2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'to the console</p>
 
    <p class="type">hey click me to the type of data is assigned to me</p>
    <p class="res"></p>

    <p class="type1">hey click me to get the bug in javascript</p>
    <p class="res1"></p>

    <h2>Assignment in let, const and var</h2>
    <p>
        1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
        countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)        
    </p>
    <p>2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
        change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
    </p>
    <p>3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens</p>

    <a class="a" href="#">click me to get whether you can change my value or not</a>
    <p class="constResult"></p>
    <p class="reason"></p>

    <h2>Assignment in Basic Operators</h2>
    <p>
        1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
            then how many people would live in each half?    </p>
    <p>2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console</p>
    <p>3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than Finland?</p>
    <p>4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country have less people than the average country?</p>
    <p>5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
        which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
        people speak portuguese'</p>
    
    <h3>Please go to the console to check the result of this assignment</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Assignment in Strings and Template Literals</h2>
    <p>
        1. Recreate the 'description' variable from the last assignment, this time
        using the template literal syntax
    </p>
    <h3>Please go to the console to check the result of this assignment</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Assignment in if / else Statements</h2>
    <p>
        1. If your country's population is greater that 33 million, log a string like this to the
        console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. Otherwise, log a string like
        'Portugal's population is 22 million below average' (the 22 is the average of 33
        minus the country's population)
   </p>
    <p>2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to
        130. See the different results, and set the population back to original
    </p>

<h2>Assignment in Type Conversion and Coercion</h2>
    <p>
        1. Predict the result of these 5 operations without executing them:
        '9' - '5';
        '19' - '13' + '17';
        '19' - '13' + 17;
        '123' < 57;
        5 + 6 + '4' + 9 - 4 - 2;
   </p>
    <p>2. Execute the operations to check if you were right</p>
