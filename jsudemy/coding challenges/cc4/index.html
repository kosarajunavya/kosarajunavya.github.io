    <!-- <h1>coding challenge 4</h1>
    <p>Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
        restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
        300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
    </p>
    <h2>Your tasks:</h2>
    <p>1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for
        this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement üòÖ (If it's easier for you, you can
        start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
        operator!)
    </p>
    <p>2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
        (bill + tip). Example: ‚ÄúThe bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
        316.25‚Äù
    </p>
    <h2>Test data:</h2>
    <p>Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430</p>
    <h3>Hints:</h3>
    <p>To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
         Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300
