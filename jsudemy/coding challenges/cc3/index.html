    <!-- <h1>coding challenge 3</h1>
    <p>There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
        other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
    </p>
    <h2>Your tasks:</h2>
    <p>1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below</p>
    <p>2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
        and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
        as well (draw means they have the same average score)</p>
    <p>3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
        team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
        score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
        score, as well as multiple else-if blocks</p>
    <p>4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
        both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
        points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
    </p>
        <h2>Test data</h2>
    <p>Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110</p>
    <p>Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123</p>
    <p>Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106</p> -->
