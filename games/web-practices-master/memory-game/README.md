With this project you can learn how to make a memmory game & 3D card flipping with Javascript and CSS rotate transform style.

We will create a 4x4 grid dynamically with Javascript, select a random symbol for each pairs of cells and append them in to the DOM.
Later we will add event listeners and according classes to cell elements.
Lastly add game logic and game over check.

Here are some challenges for you to improve this game and Javascript coding skills.
Next steps;
- We use alphabet characters as symbols to match. You can add an icon pack or image set to improve visual.
- Add a restart button. 
- Add a timer and save records on local storage.
