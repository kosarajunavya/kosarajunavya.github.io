Create 2048 game with Javascript and CSS. 

2048 is a great game first made by Gabriele Cirulli for mobile devices.
The goal of this game is merge numbers and reach maximum number you can get.
Game is over when you fill all 16 squares and have no move to make.

This is a great example for beginner web developers to work on.
