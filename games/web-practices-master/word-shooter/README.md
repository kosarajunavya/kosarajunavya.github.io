ZTYPE is old and great game to practice keyboard skills with joy.
In this speed code video I created a simple clone of ZTYPE game 
where a random word from word list spawn around our red hero and we kill them
by typing their letters.

This example uses ES6 Modules import and export. Some browsers may have trouble with it.

Next steps to improve this example,
- change hero element with an image and rotate it to the target
- create a shooting animation from hero to target
- create an explosion animation for letters
- save scores and alert for records
- add waves/levels and change word letter count depending on level
